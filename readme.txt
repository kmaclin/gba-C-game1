My game is my own short version of "World's Hardest Game."
I have an intro that tells you what to do included in the game, but I'll explain here as well.

-You are the blue square, and you are trying to collect the yellow, square (yes...square) coins. 
-To pass a level, collect all the coins (use the arrow keys to move, and just run into the coins to "collect" them). 
-If you are hit by a red square, you will be moved back to your start point and will have to collect all the coins you had up until that point over again, so avoid the red squares!

Have fun! The second level is intense!
